# @nxpm/stack

## Introduction

`@nxpm/stack` is a set of schematics that generates an opinionated full-stack application in a Nx Workspace based on the PANNG Stack (Prisma, Angular, Nest, Nx, GraphQL).

## Creating a new project

> Currently, creating a project is a manual process. This will be simplified soon‚Ñ¢!Ô∏è

Create a new Nx Workspace and make sure to use the `empty` preset!

```shell script
yarn create nx-workspace sandbox --preset=empty --nx-cloud true --cli=angular
cd sandbox
```

Install the dependencies:

```shell script
yarn add -D @nxpm/stack @nrwl/angular @nrwl/nest
```

Initialize a new project (where admin is the name of the Angular frontend):

```shell script
nx g @nxpm/stack:init admin
```

## Running the project

Before you can run the stack, there are some things you need to do.

### Starting the Docker server

The stack is configured to connect to a Postgres server on `localhost:5432` with a database called `prisma`, username `prisma` and password `prisma`.

There is a `docker-compose.yml` in the project root which provides this.

To start the server, run the following command:

```shell script
docker-compose up
```

### Seed the database

When starting with an empty database, you need to make sure the table structure gets created.

To do this, run the following command:

```shell script
yarn setup
```

### Start the API

You can now start the API by running the following command:

```shell script
yarn dev:api
```

You should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) and see the GraphQL Playground.

### Generate the SDK

Once the API is up and running, we want to make sure we can generate the SDK that is being used by the frontend.

Run the following command to generate the SDK:

```shell script
yarn sdk
```

### Start the Admin

With this all done, you can now start the Admin by running the following command:

```shell script
yarn dev:admin
```

You should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and see the Angular app.
